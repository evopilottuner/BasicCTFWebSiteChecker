# BasicCTFWebSiteChecker
Quick python script to check back end file access

Simple script to prompt for a target website

Then checks access to 4 simple files (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, humans.txt and security.txt)

Saves output to your desktop in TXT formet

This is simply a way of finding some hidden flags during a CTF or a badly configurered website in production nothing else
